1. Introduction                                       *unnest-introduction*

Imagine that you are in a terminal buffer in Nvim, and you run a command that
opens a new Nvim instance (e.g., `git commit`). Now you have a Neovim session
running inside another Neovim session. This can be confusing and inefficient.

`unnest.nvim` solves this by detecting when it's being run in a nested
session, then it will instruct the parent Neovim instance to open files in a
in the parent Neovim instance.

NOTE: there are some other plugins that do similar thing, like
    `flatten.nvim` <https://github.com/willothy/flatten.nvim>,
    `nvim-unception` <https://github.com/samjwill/nvim-unception>, etc. Please
    make sure you have removed or disabled them before installing this plugin,
    because they can conflict with each other.

2. Usage                                                 *unnest-usage*

|unnest.nvim| should work automatically. There is no configuration needed.

When you run a command in terminal buffer that would open a Nvim instance, the
parent Nvim instance will open a new |tabpage| with the same layout as the child
Nvim instance. The child Nvim instance will be kept until you close that new
|tabpage|. This is usefull when you use commands like `git commit`, `git mergetool`,
etc.

NOTE: this plugin won't work if you lazy-load it. And actually you shouldn't
need lazy-loading for this plugin because it has very small startup time.

COMMANDS ~

*:UnnestEdit* {cmd}
    Run {cmd} in a Nvim terminal buffer in the current |window|. All
    |cmdline-special| characters in {cmd} are expanded. If it opens a Nvim
    instance with a file path, the file will be opened in the parent Nvim
    instance, and the child Nvim instance will be closed right away.

    As you can see, the behavior is a bit different from the default behavior,
    instead of opening a new |tabpage|, this command just opens file in the
    current |window|, and the child Nvim instance is not kept. This is useful
    when you want to use another terminal file explorer with Nvim.

    Some example usages:

    - Using with `fzf` <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf>: >vim
        :UnnestEdit nvim $(fzf)
<
    - Using with `yazi` <https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi>: >vim
        :UnnestEdit yazi
<

VARIABLES ~

*g:loaded_unnest*
    If this variable has been set before the plugin is loaded, the plugin will
    not be loaded. You can set this variable in your |config| file to disable
    the plugin.

3. Tips                                                *unnest-tips*

HOW TO USE NVIM AS THE EDITOR FOR GIT? ~

This plugin already set $VISUAL and $EDITOR to `nvim`, so `git commit` and
`git rebase -i` should use Nvim as the editor, unless you set have some
settings that takes higher priority (like $GIT_EDITOR or `git config`).

However, `git mergetool` and `git difftool` don't use either `$VISUAL` or
`$EDITOR`, but you can use the following commands to set them to use Nvim: >sh
    git config --global merge.tool nvimdiff
    git config --global diff.tool nvimdiff


I DON'T WANT CHILD NVIM TO OPEN FILES IN PARENT NVIM FOR A TERMINAL SESSION ~

You just need to set |g:loaded_unnest| in |--cmd| flag of Nvim command. For
example: >sh
    nvim --cmd "let g:loaded_unnest = 1" README.md

Alternatively, you can also remove environmental variable |$NVIM| >sh
    unset NVIM
